# GO Election
fast and lightweight online election app written with [Go](https://go.dev/)

## About
With the 2024 Indonesian elections approaching, I thought of creating a simple election application that is light and fast. Therefore, I made this project using Golang with the Fiber and Gorm framework with JWT authentication for the backend, while for the user side frontend I only used the native version.

## Requirement
- Go v1.18 or higher
- Go Fiber 
- Gorm
- JWT

## How to use
- clone this repo
- run: ```go mod tidy```
- run: ```go run main.go```
